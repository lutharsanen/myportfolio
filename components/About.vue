                I am a data scientist from Switzerland with a flair for Blockchain and Finance.
                After finishing my Matura, I started with my Bachelor Degree in Banking & Finance. When I did my
                Bachelor Thesis in a blockchain project in the ECON departement of the University of Zurich as part
                of the IT-team, I found my passion for computer science and blockchain. The data
                science master got me a deep dive into the world of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. If you are
                looking for a data scientist, which is familiar to blockchain and software engineering and knows how
                to think like an economist, contact me via the contact form.
